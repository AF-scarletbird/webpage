    <h2>About Alex</h2>

    <p>I'm currently an undergrad student at the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) pursuing an Electrical Engineering major.<br>
        Although my interests include racquet sports (tennis, badminton, pickleball), my interests most promimently featured on this webpage are card and puzzle games.
        I've been a long-time solver of word puzzles (crosswords, etc.) and logic puzzles, but only recently have I begun to start constructing these puzzles.
        In addition, I've also created some solitiaire implementations both as a product of my interest in card games and to practice programming.
        Hopefully as time passes, I build more stuff to put on this webpage!<br>
